This is the DSSD I built in the summer vacation. Its mAP and F1 are relatively low. 
This is due to the loss function and some parameter problems. Of course, there may be bugs. 
The model does not completely imitate paper, but arbitrarily modify a large number of parts. 
Although it does not look perfect, its overall architecture is relatively clear.

If you have any questions, you can contact me and you will get my reply soon.
